# Decommissioned Machines Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The decommissioned machines feature has been fully implemented and is ready for the next Render deployment. This feature allows authorized users to mark machines as decommissioned, hiding them from active dashboards and operations while preserving historical data.

## Database Migration
✅ **Migration Script**: `add_machine_decommissioned_fields.py`
- Adds 4 new columns to the `machines` table:
  - `decommissioned` (BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL)
  - `decommissioned_date` (TIMESTAMP NULL)
  - `decommissioned_by` (INTEGER NULL - references users.id)
  - `decommissioned_reason` (TEXT NULL)

✅ **Auto-Migration**: Integrated into `auto_migrate.py`
- The migration will run automatically on app startup in Render
- Uses PostgreSQL-compatible TIMESTAMP data type
- Includes error handling and logging

## Model Changes
✅ **Machine Model** (`models.py`):
- Added decommissioned fields with proper relationships
- Helper methods: `decommission()`, `recommission()`, `is_active()`
- Automatic tracking of decommissioning user and timestamp

## UI Implementation
✅ **Admin Machine Management** (`templates/admin/machines.html`):
- Status badges showing Active/Decommissioned
- Toggle to show/hide decommissioned machines
- Visual indicators (icons, colors)

✅ **Machine Edit Form** (`templates/edit_machine.html`):
- Decommissioning toggle with permission checks
- Optional reason field
- Historical decommissioning information display
- JavaScript for dynamic UI behavior

## Backend Filtering
✅ **Dashboard Routes**: Updated to exclude decommissioned machines from:
- Main dashboard statistics
- Parts management
- Maintenance calculations
- Audit history

✅ **API Endpoints**: Updated to filter decommissioned machines from:
- Machine listings
- Site machine queries
- Parts management operations

✅ **Admin Views**: Enhanced to show both active and total counts:
- Active machine count
- Total machine count
- Decommissioned machine count

## Permission System
✅ **Access Control**:
- Only admin users or users with 'machines.decommission' permission can decommission
- Decommissioning UI only shown to authorized users
- Historical data remains accessible

## Routes Updated to Filter Decommissioned Machines
✅ **Routes that now exclude decommissioned machines by default**:
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard statistics
- `/parts` - Parts management
- `/maintenance` - Maintenance operations
- `/machines` - Machine listing (with toggle option)
- Audit history views
- API endpoints for machine data

## Render Deployment Ready
✅ **Auto-Migration Setup**:
- Migration integrated into app startup sequence
- Will run automatically on next Render deployment
- Error handling and logging included
- PostgreSQL compatibility ensured

## What Happens on Next Deployment
1. App starts up on Render
2. `auto_migrate.py` runs automatically
3. Decommissioned fields are added to machines table (if not already present)
4. Existing machines default to `decommissioned=FALSE`
5. Feature becomes immediately available to authorized users

## Testing Recommendations
After deployment:
1. Verify migration completed successfully in logs
2. Test decommissioning a machine as admin
3. Confirm decommissioned machines are hidden from dashboard
4. Verify toggle functionality in admin/machines view
5. Test recommissioning functionality

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Email notifications when machines are decommissioned
- Bulk decommissioning operations
- Reports on decommissioned machines
- Asset disposal tracking
