echo "    - Verify SocketIO initialization messages appear"
echo "    - Test SocketIO connection from offline client"
echo ""
echo "  SocketIO Connection Issues (offline clients):"
echo "    - Look for 'write() before start_response' errors"
echo "    - Check client console for '[SocketIO] Connection failed' messages"
echo "    - Verify CORS origins include offline client URLs"
echo "    - Check if client is using polling transport before websocket upgrade"
echo "    - Monitor ping/pong messages for connection health"
echo ""
echo "  If offline clients can't connect:"
echo "    - Ensure AMRS_ONLINE_URL in .env points to correct server"
echo "    - Check firewall/network settings allowing SocketIO traffic"
echo "    - Verify server is using 'python wsgi.py' not gunicorn"
